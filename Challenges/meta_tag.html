			<h1>Media Queries</h1>
			<p>In CSS2 the @media rule was introduced, allowing different styling rules for different types of devices.<br>

                For example, there could be one set of styling for a computer screen and another set of styling for printed (hard copy) content. <br>
                
                In CSS3, this idea was extended (through the use of media queries) which check the capabilities of the device and display styling accordingly. <br>
                 Media queries can be used to check points such as:
                
                the width and height of the display screen
                the orientation of the screen (landscape vs. portrait)
                screen resolution.</p>
